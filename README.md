`WinUi++` is developed by C++ and is a simplest `RPA` tool that runs on windows 10 1809 and above.

### Introduce

A simple RPA tool, which can easily design a variety of automated processes with graphical interfaces, and then perform on various Windows platforms.For example, you can use image recognition and use the mouse simulation to help you complete a variety of complicated operations.Whether it is playing games and work, it is an indispensable tool.

Different from other RPA software, `WinUi++` is based on Microsoft's latest `WindowsAppsDK`. It is developed with C ++, which fully considers the convenience of performance and execution efficiency and process design.And the interface uses the `Windows Winui library` (the latest Windows 10 native control and Fluent style), making `WinUi++` more beautiful and modern.

`WinUi++` will never embed any advertisements and bundle any software.It will not play hooligans like a large domestic factory! For example, when installing, add a variety of bundles, and accidentally installed a family barrel from a certain family.When you uninstall it, you have to turn your brains and turns in a hurry to make you doubt the IQ and even doubt your life.
